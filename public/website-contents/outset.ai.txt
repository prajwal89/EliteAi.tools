Trusted by the best

Outset saved us over 120 hours of research on a single project while delivering high quality insights that cannot be achieved with a survey. This is the future of research.

Brynna Mann
Managing Director


The speed and quality of the responses were outstanding. Outset will afford my team the opportunity to significantly increase the speed of delivery.

Wil Readinger
Head of UX Research


Outset's AI engaged users and asked follow-up questions that elicited specific, long-form answers that helped us understand what was important to them. And it did so at 10x-20x scale of customer interviews.

Jeff Zimmerman
Chief Product Officer


Outset was able to gain so many insights in such a short period of time from so many respondents â€“ and then seeing everything analyzed helped me understand the story really quicklyâ€¦10 out 10.

William Rothwell, PhD 
Senior Innovations Researcher


Outset allows users to spend their time on what really matters, which is understanding the consumer and designing products, rather than on countless hours of interviewing and labeling.
